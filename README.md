- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Linden-Row
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things! I'm here because I'm interested in re-learning how to code.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm old enough to have learned languages like FORTRAN and COBOL in school. The last language I did any amount of coding in was Pascal.
